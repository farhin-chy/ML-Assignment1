# Recognize a Digit using Machine Learning (TensorFlow)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project uses the **MNIST dataset** to train a neural network that can recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) using **TensorFlow** in Google Colab.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Loads the MNIST dataset (60,000 training images, 10,000 testing images).
- Normalizes the data for better performance.
- Builds and trains a fully connected neural network.
- Evaluates model accuracy and plots training history.
